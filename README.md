# guw_wpToolTips
A plugin for WordPress which adds a meta box to posts in which you can chose a word to add the tool tip hover effect to, write content for the tool tip, pick the color of the tool tip, and upload an image if needed/wanted.

The "word to add tool tip to" will need to be it's own word (at this point). 
Example:
If you want to hover over "final", but the word "finally" is also in your post then a tool tip will be added to the "final" in "finally" as well.

HTML can be added into the content section (I haven't tested this yet with embedding videos)

This is my first plugin, so be kind :)
